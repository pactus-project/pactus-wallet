# Add/Update Documentation for the Pactus Wallet

## Description

This issue proposes to create or update documentation for the Pactus Wallet based on the design
specifications in Figma. Comprehensive documentation is essential for developers, contributors, and
users to understand the wallet's functionality, features, and architecture.

## Figma Design Reference

The documentation should be aligned with the UI/UX design specifications available at:
[Pactus Wallet Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/IbrUO2VLEFVVxSEciRbWDq/Pactus-Wallet?node-id=5-191&p=f&t=arfs4B9akc9FNZqv-0)

## Proposed Documentation Scope

### User Documentation

- Installation guides for all supported platforms
- Getting started guide
- Wallet creation and recovery
- Transaction management
- Account settings and preferences
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting common issues

### Developer Documentation

- Architecture overview
- Code organization (monorepo structure)
- Tech stack details
- Development environment setup
- Contributing guidelines
- Building and testing

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing documentation (if any)
2. Compare with current Figma designs to identify gaps
3. Draft new documentation sections
4. Review with the team
5. Implement approved documentation
6. Ensure documentation is accessible and discoverable

## Additional Considerations

- Consider using a documentation platform/generator (e.g., Docusaurus, VuePress)
- Include screenshots aligned with the latest Figma designs
- Ensure documentation is versioned alongside the software

## Success Criteria

- Complete coverage of all user-facing features
- Clear instructions for developers to contribute
- Documentation aligned with actual UI/UX in the current release
- Positive feedback from community members and contributors
